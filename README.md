> **WARNING**: Your existing nginx/php/mariadb setup will be over written. Up to now I tested this only on newly installed AWS EC2 Ubuntu, Dedian, Fedora and CentOS machines. So backup of your existing configuration is a good advice.

> **WARNING**: This playbook is not compatible with older versions. Do not run this version on older installations.

> **WARNING**: This branch is work in progress. Not all combinations are tested. Some don't work yet.
