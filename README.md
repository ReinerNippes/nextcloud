Warning: Your existing nginx/php/mariadb setup will be over written. Up to now I tested this only on newly installed AWS EC2 Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora and CentOS machines. So backup of your existing configuration is a good advice.

Requirements
------------

Ubuntu 16.04 und 18.04, CentOS 7, Debian 9 und 10, Amazon Linux 2, Fedora 30

Not yet tested with other versions and flavours of Linux.

Install
-------

```bash
# prepare your os and install ansible
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReinerNippes/nextcloud/master/prepare_system.sh | /bin/bash

# clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/ReinerNippes/nextcloud

# change to nextcloud directory
cd nextcloud

# edit variables
vim inventory

# run the playbook
./nextcloud.yml

# on debian use sudo
sudo ./nextcloud.yml

# on Fedora use
./nextcloud.yml -e 'ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3'

# if your are fine with the defaults in the inventory (e.g. db version) just provide the ssl parameter
./nextcloud.yml -e fqdn=nc.example.org -e ssl_certificate_type=letsencrypt -e 'cert_email=nc@example.org'
or
./nextcloud.yml -e fqdn=nc.example.org -e ssl_certificate_type=selfsigned
or
./nextcloud.yml -e fqdn=nc.example.org -e ssl_certificate_type=selfsigned -e nc_db_type=mysql
```

> **WARNING**: Remember to update the inventory file if you want to run the playbook later again. E.g. to update the system. If you don't the defaults in the inventory file will be apply during the second run.

Login to your nextcloud web site <https://nc.example.org>

Users and passwords have been set according to the entries in the inventory if defined there. Otherwise the admin password will be displayed at the end of playbook. Additional you can find them in the credential_store = /etc/nextcloud
